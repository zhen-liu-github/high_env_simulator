# high_env_simulator
This repository is based on the [Highway-env](https://github.com/eleurent/highway-env) and aims to compare different lane change method's performances.

## Env config.
The env distribution of the simulator will affect the mothod performance. And a perfect simulator shoule have a realistic env and can focus on difficult parts. 
Currently, speed distribution of ego car and obstacles, obstacles num, average distance between obstacles, lane num, lane change direction and so on.

### Speed distribution
The speed of ego car and lane change window have a huge impact on lane change motion. A typically overall speed distribution is seems like the following.

![speed distribution fig](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/80379828/112961465-fa375c80-9177-11eb-850e-36b0ed17822b.png "speed_distribution_fig")

Firstly, we sample ego speed 
![](http://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?V_{ego})
and obs speed 
![](http://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?V_{obs})
For each obs speed, we sampele the velocity 
![](http://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?V_{0bs_i})
from a narrow norm distribution with loc=
![](http://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?V_{obs_i})
scale = 
![](http://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?V_{obs_i}^{0.5})

### Obs num
The more obstacles, the more difficult to lane change. To ensure a relistic and difficult lane change scenario, we set 
![](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?N_{obs}=Int(N(8,&space;2))&space;)
![obs num distribution](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/80379828/112961643-23f08380-9178-11eb-8bc6-4f5ea16a4d4a.png "obs num distribution")

### Average distance between obstacles
We set distance between adjacent obs according to their speeds and obs num.
![](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?D_{obs}=max(D_{safe},&space;\frac{200}{obs_{num}}&plus;U(-4,&space;4)))


### Lane num
Currently we only consider 2 lane.
### Lane change direction
Currently, we only consider lane change left.

## Vehicle action
### ego_car
* Increase velocity control accuracy and speed range.
* Disable front obs lane change when ego car do a lane change.
For convenienceï¼Œ we use a MDP-Vehicle model with a specified discrete range of allowed target speeds which use a high leve which use a high level action.
The action space consists of Faster, Slower, IDLE, Left lane change, Right lane change. And the discrete target speed is defined as 
![](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?V_{target}=V_{min}&plus;V_{index}*\frac{(V_{max}-V_{min})}{V_{count}-1). The default 
![](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?V_{max}=30)
![](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?V_{min}=20)
![](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?V_{count}=3)
For a accuracy speed control, we set  
![](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?V_{min}=0)
![](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?V_{count}=19)
And the target and real speed fig of above config are shown as

* Increase target_speed .

The yellow window is the target window with the minimum chasing window time.



# run script with data-driven window selection.

The yellow window is the target window with the highest window confidence and blue windows are all feasible lane change window.
(The train dataset comes from rule-based window selection simulations.)
